          <Para className="">
            We founded Clario AI because we believe that everyoneâ€”individuals,
            families, freelancers, and businessesâ€”deserves clarity, security,
            and control over their documents.
          </Para>
          <Para className="mt-2">
            Contracts, invoices, insurance policies, tax filesâ€”these define our
            professional and personal lives, yet they are often confusing,
            time-consuming, and risky. Our mission is to change that.

          <Para className="mt-2">
            By combining artificial intelligence with a human-centered approach,
            we are building a platform that makes legal and bureaucratic
            documents:

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-5">
            <li>Easier to understand</li>

          </ul>
          <Para className="mt-2">
            We want to give people back their time, their peace of mind, and
            their freedomâ€”while reducing the stress and cost of bureaucracy.
